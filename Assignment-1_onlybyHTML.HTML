  <h2>Review</h2>
  <h5> ★★★★</h5>
  <p>"Rich Dad Poor Dad" by Robert T. Kiyosaki offers a contrasting view between his biological father's traditional approach to money and his friend's father's entrepreneurial mindset. It emphasizes the importance of financial education, asset acquisition, and passive income to achieve financial freedom. The book simplifies complex financial concepts and encourages readers to rethink their approach to wealth building. While it's motivational and practical, some criticize its oversimplification and the riskiness of its advice. Overall, it's recommended for its fresh perspective on personal finance and wealth creation."
